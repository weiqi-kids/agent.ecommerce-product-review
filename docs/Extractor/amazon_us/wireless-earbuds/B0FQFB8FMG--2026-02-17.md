## L6: Evidence-Based Summary

### Strengths
1. **noise_cancellation** (92% positive, 42 mentions): 世界級的主動降噪表現,相比 AirPods Pro 2 有顯著提升,能有效隔絕環境噪音,讓使用者完全沉浸於音樂或通話中。多位使用者表示降噪效果是他們體驗過最好的。

2. **sound_quality** (85% positive, 38 mentions): 音質表現優異,低音更加深沉且控制良好,人聲清晰,整體音場豐富且平衡。相比前代產品有明顯的音質提升,適合聆聽各類音樂。

3. **battery_life** (88% positive, 18 mentions): 電池續航力表現出色,多位使用者表示可支撐全天工作使用(8-9 小時),相比 Pro 2 有顯著改善。

4. **live_translation** (75% positive, 12 mentions): 即時翻譯功能運作良好,在實際測試中能提供近即時的語言轉換,適合旅行或跨語言溝通場景,雖然偶有延遲但整體表現令人印象深刻。

5. **controls** (85% positive, 7 mentions): 全新的手勢控制設計受到好評,可自訂設置,操作直覺且便利。

### Weaknesses
1. **previous_owner_connected** (6% report): 嚴重的品質控制問題——多位買家收到的「全新」產品仍連接至前任擁有者的 iCloud 帳號,導致位置被追蹤的隱私安全疑慮。這顯示 Amazon 的退貨/重新包裝流程存在重大漏洞。

2. **fit_discomfort_pro2_users** (8% report): 從 AirPods Pro 2 升級的使用者普遍反映 Pro 3 的舒適度下降,長時間配戴會感到耳朵疼痛,最長僅能配戴 2-3 小時。這可能與耳塞設計改變有關。

3. **falls_out_during_exercise** (6% report): 運動時容易脫落,特別是在健身房或跑步時,儘管號稱有更安全的貼合設計,但實際表現未如預期。

4. **poor_condition_received** (5% report): 收到的產品狀況不佳,包括充電盒嚴重刮傷、殘留耳垢、包裝髒污等,顯示 Amazon 對「全新」或「翻新」產品的品檢標準不足。

5. **disconnection_issues** (5% report): 反覆出現斷線重連問題,即使重置、更新韌體也無法解決,影響使用體驗。

6. **defective_after_short_use** (4% report): 多起案例顯示產品在購買後 1-2 個月內即出現故障(無法充電、過熱、單邊失效),且發生時間常超過 Amazon 退貨期限,需透過 Apple 保固處理。

7. **hearing_aid_not_working** (3% report): 助聽功能無法正常運作,即使尋求專業聽力師協助也無法啟用,產生嘯叫聲,與行銷宣稱不符。

8. **static_noise** (3% report): 部分單元出現刺耳的高頻噪音或靜電聲,影響使用體驗。
