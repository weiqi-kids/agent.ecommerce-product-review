### 使用者旅程分析

**Discovery (發現階段)**:
- 主要透過品牌知名度和皮膚科醫師推薦進入考慮清單
- 敏感肌使用者特別尋找「alcohol-free」和「ophthalmologist-tested」標示
- 環保意識者被「100% plant-based, compostable」特性吸引

**First Use (初次使用)**:
- 使用者驚訝於「不需用力擦拭」就能卸除頑固彩妝
- "effortlessly dissolve", "melt away makeup" 是高頻出現的第一印象詞彙
- 溫和度立即可感知："no burning, no tugging"

**Daily Integration (日常整合)**:
- 產品快速成為床邊/浴室必備品："Leave by bed in case I forgot to wash face"
- 便利性促成懶人護膚："fresh-faced moments effortless anywhere"
- 從「卸妝步驟」升級為「護膚儀式感」的一部分

**Long-term Loyalty (長期忠誠)**:
- 極高的重購率："have them on auto renew so I never run out"
- 品牌轉換障礙："I've tried so many brands, nothing has come close"
- 多代使用傳承："My girls and I use them daily"

### 未被滿足的需求（白地機會）

1. **更大尺寸選項** (2% 使用者反應尺寸不足)
   - 機會：推出「XL Size」版本滿足濃妝使用者
   - 潛在市場：專業彩妝師、舞台表演者

2. **保濕加強版** (4% 使用者反應眼周乾澀)
   - 機會：添加透明質酸/甘油的「Hydrating Plus」系列
   - 潛在市場：乾性肌、冬季護膚需求

3. **包裝改良** (4% 使用者反應濕巾變乾)
   - 機會：改用單片獨立包裝或改良密封條技術

4. **天然配方升級** (<1% 但增長中的需求)
   - 機會：推出「Clean Beauty」認證版本（EWG Verified）
   - 潛在市場：千禧世代、Z世代環保意識族群

### 產品生命週期定位
**成熟期 (Mature Stage)** - 市場領導者地位穩固，持續透過配方創新和環保升級維持競爭力。

**風險信號**:
- 單一使用者提及「召回」(recall)，雖未經證實但需監控品質控管議題
- 化學成分疑慮雖是少數，但反映消費者對「Clean Beauty」的期待上升

**機會信號**:
- 訂閱制購買 (Subscribe & Save) 顯示高度使用者黏著
- 跨世代使用（母女共用）創造品牌傳承價值
- 環保材料 (compostable) 成為新的購買動機

### 聲明驗證

**需進一步驗證**:

### 策略建議

**短期 (0-6個月)**:
1. 調查召回聲明真實性，若為誤傳應主動澄清
2. 改良密封包裝技術，降低濕巾變乾的批次問題
3. 在產品頁面強化「敏感肌適用但建議先測試」的使用指引

**中期 (6-12個月)**:
1. 推出保濕加強版滿足乾性肌需求
2. 開發單片獨立包裝的旅行裝系列
3. 取得 Clean Beauty 相關認證（如 EWG Verified）

**長期 (12個月以上)**:
1. 建立「永續美妝」品牌形象，強化環保材料創新
