## L5: Issue Patterns

| Issue | Frequency | Severity | Representative Quotes |
|---|---|---|---|
| socks_poor_quality | 15/66 (23%) | low | "The socks felt very thin and flimsy...the sock quality was not as good as the rest of the items"; "Unlike everything else in the set, which feels above-average quality...the socks feel a bit cheap. They have a low-quality, polyester-like feel" |
| candle_scent_disappointing | 8/66 (12%) | low | "The candle is a mystery. The box says 'fragrance candle' but no where on the box nor candle does it say what the scent is. It seemed subtle, but made my nose itch a bit"; "Not sure I like the smell - seems pungent and I'm not really sure what the fragrance is supposed to be" |
| bracelet_clasp_difficulty | 7/66 (11%) | low | "She had a bit of trouble clasping it. The elastic band would also ensure that it could fit any wrist as my mother is thin and has very small wrists"; "It probably would have been better with an elastic band that she could just slip on and off" |
| candle_size_small | 6/66 (9%) | low | "The candle while its really small it smells very good"; "The candle is probably one of the weaker points, though it is still quite nice. The lid on mine arrived slightly dented" |
| card_no_message | 4/66 (6%) | low | "The card it included had no messages inside, which can be good so you can write your own message if this is a gift, however for me since it was for me, i wish the card had something pre written on it" |
