## L6: Evidence-Based Summary

### Strengths
1. **skin_softness** (91% positive, 34 mentions): Users consistently report waking up with extremely soft, baby-like skin after overnight use. The product delivers exceptional smoothness that is immediately noticeable.
2. **skin_glow** (88% positive, 38 mentions): Creates a luminous, healthy "glass skin" effect that users describe as their skin looking more radiant, refreshed, and glowing without appearing greasy.
3. **skin_plumpness** (87% positive, 15 mentions): Delivers visible plumping effects quickly, with users noticing firmer, tighter-looking skin within one day of use.
4. **pore_appearance** (86% positive, 7 mentions): Significantly reduces the appearance of large pores, making them less visible and improving overall skin texture.
5. **value_for_money** (85% positive, 18 mentions): Excellent price-to-performance ratio with a generous amount of product that lasts a long time due to the small amount needed per application.
6. **hydration** (72% positive, 47 mentions): Provides substantial hydration for most users, particularly effective for dry skin types when used in nighttime routines.

### Weaknesses
1. **sticky_residue** (41% report): The most frequently mentioned issue - product leaves a very sticky, tacky feeling that persists for hours, making daytime use and makeup application difficult or impossible for many users.
2. **poor_absorption** (14% report): Does not fully absorb into skin for some users, instead sitting on the surface without delivering perceived benefits, often accompanied by oily feeling.
3. **skin_irritation_reaction** (12% report): Causes significant reactions in some users including redness, burning, stinging, hot/tingly sensations, and blotchy skin, even among those who typically have non-sensitive skin.
4. **causes_dryness** (8% report): Paradoxically dries out skin for some users despite being a moisturizer, leading to flaking and desert-like texture, particularly problematic for mature skin.
5. **acne_breakouts** (8% report): Triggers new pimples and breakouts in users who rarely experience acne, suggesting potential pore-clogging ingredients despite claims of being suitable for sensitive skin.
6. **makeup_pilling** (5% report): When layered under sunscreen or makeup, the product pills up and creates little balls that roll off the face.
