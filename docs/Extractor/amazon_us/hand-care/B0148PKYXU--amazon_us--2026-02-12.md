  - "getting it out of the tube is very hard. It does not flow very well - almost like the hole is too small to use properly" (batch 2)
- **Possible Causes**: Temperature-related thickness, tube design (thick walls, small opening), product formulation
- **Note**: Isolated but consistent complaint about packaging design
