## L5: Issue Patterns

| Issue | Frequency | Severity | Representative Quotes |
|---|---|---|---|
| difficult_tube_dispensing | 3/50 (6%) | medium | "The tubes are very thick-walled and it's difficult to squeeze hard enough to get most of the product out, especially when there are only 3 ounces to begin with", "getting it out of the tube is very hard. It does not flow very well - almost like the hole is too small to use properly" |
| limited_effectiveness | 2/50 (4%) | medium | "it didn't work for me and my sister. It just moisturized little bit not as I expected", "this cream doesn't work much better for me than other drug store creams. This cream is fragrance free, not greasy & absorbs fairly quickly, all good features. But it also wears off fast, and washes off. It is not repairing" |
| small_quantity | 2/50 (4%) | low | "3 ounces doesn't go very far, at least for me", "the 3 pack of lotion is ONLY 3 ounces in total - each tube is ONLY 1 tiny ounce - and it's a total ripoff" |
| missing_safety_seal | 1/50 (2%) | low | "Did not arrive with a safety seal or plastic wrap on the container of okeefes working hands cream. How do I know it wasn't used already?" |
| sticky_residue | 1/50 (2%) | low | "A little sticky" |
