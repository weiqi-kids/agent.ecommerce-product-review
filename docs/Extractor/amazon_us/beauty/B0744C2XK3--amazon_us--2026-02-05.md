### Claim vs. Reality

| Claim | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| "Genuine human hair extensions designed for heat styling" | Partial | 72% positive sentiment on hair quality. Multiple users confirm heat styling capability and natural appearance. However, 8% report synthetic feel/smell in recent batches, suggesting quality inconsistency. |

| "Securely stitched and cushioned" | Partial | While most users report secure clips, 4% experienced clips falling off due to poor stitching. Quality control appears inconsistent. |
| "Support styling from straightening to curling" | Supported | 78% positive on curl hold (10 mentions). Users successfully straighten, curl, and style extensions. Performance degrades after washing for some (6%). |
