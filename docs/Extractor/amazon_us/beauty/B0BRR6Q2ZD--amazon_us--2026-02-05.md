The Eachy logo is a stamp, that I'm sure will wear off in no time. It came wrapped in scotch tape packaging, and the tags were detached and found inside. I'm thinking I got a damaged, used product" |
| saggy_side_pocket | 1/50 (2%) | low | "The side pocket is saggy. I would like it to be tighter" |
