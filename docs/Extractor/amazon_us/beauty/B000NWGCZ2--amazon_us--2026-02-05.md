## L6: Evidence-Based Summary

### Strengths
1. **moisturizing_effectiveness** (92% positive, 38 mentions): Highly effective at deep hydration, particularly for dry, sensitive, and compromised skin barriers. Users with eczema, psoriasis, and tretinoin-related dryness report significant improvement. Works well as both daily moisturizer and intensive treatment.

2. **skin_sensitivity** (94% positive, 18 mentions): Exceptional for sensitive and acne-prone skin. Non-comedogenic formula confirmed by users - doesn't cause breakouts. Safe for babies and pediatric dermatologist-recommended for eczema treatment.

3. **scent_free** (85% positive, 12 mentions): Genuinely fragrance-free as advertised, though some users note a slight natural ingredient smell that varies by batch. Appreciated by those with fragrance sensitivities.

4. **price_value** (88% positive, 8 mentions): Excellent value proposition. Large container lasts months to over a year with regular use. Cost-effective compared to luxury skincare brands with similar results.

5. **container_size** (86% positive, 7 mentions): 16 fl oz pump bottle provides long-lasting supply, reducing repurchase frequency.

### Weaknesses
1. **poor_absorption_pilling** (12% report): Some users experience poor absorption, with product sitting on skin surface, feeling sticky, or pilling when layered with other products. More common with facial use than body application.

2. **texture_too_thick** (10% report): Consistency considered too heavy by some users, particularly for facial use in warm climates or for those with combination/oily skin. Described as "glue-like" or "clay-like" texture.

3. **pump_malfunction** (8% report): Pump dispenser reliability issues including complete failure, weak output, and inability to reach last 30% of product at bottom edges of container due to thick consistency.

4. **unpleasant_smell** (6% report): Minority of users find the natural ingredient smell off-putting, with batch-to-batch variation in aroma noted.

5. **facial_dryness_peeling** (4% report): Paradoxically, a small number of users experienced increased facial dryness and peeling, contrary to product claims.
