## L6: Evidence-Based Summary

### Strengths
1. **Scent** (84% positive, 42 mentions): The vanilla cashmere fragrance is overwhelmingly praised as "amazing," "yummy," and "cozy." Many users describe it as sweet, warm, and reminiscent of fresh baked cookies or vanilla cake. Multiple reviewers note it smells similar to higher-end alternatives like Sol de Janeiro 62 at half the price.

2. **Layering Compatibility** (95% positive, 9 mentions): Users report excellent results when layering with matching eos lotion and body wash, creating a long-lasting fragrance routine. This system approach enhances both scent projection and duration.

3. **Value** (88% positive, 11 mentions): At $26.99 for 6 fl oz, customers find this product well-priced compared to alternatives, particularly noting the large bottle size and quality-to-price ratio.

4. **Moisturizing Properties** (80% positive, 7 mentions): The hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and aloe formulation delivers on moisturizing claims, with users noting it's hydrating and gentle on skin.

### Weaknesses
1. **Strong Initial Alcohol Smell** (12% report): A notable portion of users experience an overpowering rubbing alcohol scent immediately after spraying, which can take several minutes to dissipate. This initial harshness detracts from the pleasant base notes.

2. **Limited Longevity** (10% report): Some users find the scent doesn't last as long as expected for a body mist, requiring frequent reapplication. Projection is described as subtle rather than strong.

3. **Spray Mechanism Issues** (4% report): A small number of users experienced complete applicator failure, where the spray mechanism stopped working entirely.

| "Hyaluronic acid to lock in moisture" | Supported | Users positively reference the hydrating formula; no reports of dryness or irritation |
| "A head-to-toe fragrance enhancer" | Supported | 9 mentions of successful layering with lotion/body wash; users apply to "body, hair" and confirm versatility |
