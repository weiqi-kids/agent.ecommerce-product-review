3. **Insufficient cutting power** (22% report): Many users report the motor lacks torque to effectively trim hair, especially nose and ear hair which is the product's primary purpose

### Claim vs. Reality

| Claim | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| "Battery operated for superior performance, power, & run time" | Contradicted | 24% of reviews report excessive battery drain and insufficient power. Multiple quotes: "Dies within 20 seconds", "barely could keep a steady rpm", "doesn't have the power" |
| "Perfect for facial hair detailing with the detail & rotary heads" | Contradicted | 22% report insufficient cutting power specifically for nose/ear hair (primary use case). "Does nothing for nose hair", "does not trim hair well" |
| "Superior blades, rugged anodized aluminum housing" | Contradicted | 52% report premature failure, 16% report poor build quality. "Flimsy build", "fell apart in two weeks", "broke after one use" |
| "Self-sharpening precision blades & quality construction" | Contradicted | Durability is the worst-rated aspect (0.15 score) with 28 mentions. "Lasted for one use", "motor doesn't have any torque" |
| "Easily detachable heads for hygienic grooming" | Partial | While heads are detachable, 16% report attachments fall off too easily or break. "Attachments fell off", "nose attachment broke within 5 minutes" |
| "Compact design can be taken virtually anywhere" | Supported | 75% positive sentiment on portability. Users confirm "travel size", "perfect for on the go" |
| "Rotary ear & nose trimmer head provides hygienic grooming" | Unverifiable | No reviews specifically discuss the hygiene benefits of separate heads |
| "Used by professionals since 1919" | Unverifiable | No reviews reference professional use or brand heritage |

**[REVIEW_NEEDED] Trigger Reasons:**
1. Extremely high failure rate (52%) indicates systemic quality control issues
2. Price anomaly: Listed at $721.64 USD which is 10-20x higher than typical market price (~$10-15) for this product - possible data error or third-party seller price gouging
3. Direct contradiction between marketing claims and user experience across multiple core features (durability, battery life, cutting power)
