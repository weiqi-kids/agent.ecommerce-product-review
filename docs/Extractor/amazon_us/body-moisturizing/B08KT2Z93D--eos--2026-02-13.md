## L6: Evidence-Based Summary

### Strengths
1. **moisturizing_effect** (92% positive, 52 mentions): Users consistently praise the lotion's exceptional moisturizing capabilities, with many noting it provides all-day hydration without needing reapplication. Multiple reviewers mention the lotion's effectiveness on very dry skin.

2. **non_greasy** (91% positive, 28 mentions): The lotion absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy or sticky residue, which users particularly appreciate for daily use.

3. **skin_softness** (94% positive, 22 mentions): High satisfaction with how the lotion makes skin feel soft and smooth after application.

4. **scent** (88% positive, 68 mentions): The vanilla cashmere scent is widely loved, described as sweet, warm, and pleasant without being overpowering for most users.

5. **absorption** (89% positive, 38 mentions): Users report fast absorption that leaves skin feeling conditioned rather than coated with a layer of product.

6. **sensitive_skin_compatibility** (88% positive, 8 mentions): Several users with sensitive skin or fragrance sensitivities report no adverse reactions and effective hydration.

### Weaknesses
1. **pump_malfunction** (15% report): A significant number of users experienced pump failure either immediately upon receipt or after partial use, making the product difficult to dispense. This is the most frequently reported issue and affects product usability.

2. **packaging_waste** (8% report): Users report that when the pump stops working around 3/4 to 1/2 bottle remaining, they must cut open the bottle to access the remaining product, leading to frustration and waste.

3. **shipping_damage** (6% report): Multiple instances of products arriving damaged, broken, or leaking, indicating potential packaging or shipping issues.

4. **scent_mismatch** (5% report): A minority of users report the scent smells chemical, old, or rancid rather than the expected vanilla cashmere fragrance, possibly indicating batch quality issues.

5. **scent_longevity** (mixed feedback): While some appreciate the moderate scent duration, others note it only lasts 3-4 hours, which contradicts the claim of "all day" fragrance.
