### Claim vs. Reality

| Claim | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| "12 IN 1 Power Strip with 8AC outlets and 4 USB ports can power up to 12 devices simultaneously" | Supported | L4 shows 95% positive sentiment for outlet_quantity with 18 mentions confirming simultaneous device charging works as advertised |
| "2.2 inches widely spaced outlets, larger than standard socket" | Supported | L4 shows 93% positive sentiment for space_design with 14 mentions specifically praising the wide spacing that prevents blocking |
| "USB C port can charge up to 5V/3A, 30% faster than other usb c charging station" | Partial | L4 shows 92% positive sentiment for usb_charging (16 mentions), but no user verification of the 30% faster claim or actual charging speeds |
| "Minimum energy-absorbing capacity of 1080 Joules" | Unverifiable | No user reviews mention or test the joule rating; L5 shows 4% fire safety incidents which raise concerns about surge protection effectiveness |
| "Overload protection protects electrical appliances from lighting, surges or spikes" | Contradicted | L5 fire_safety_risk (4%) shows units overheating and catching fire; L5 premature_failure (8%) shows units causing breakers to trip, suggesting overload protection may be inadequate |
| "5ft upgraded braided extension cord" | Supported | L4 shows 85% positive sentiment for cord_length (7 mentions) praising thickness and quality; 1 negative review about stiffness (2%) |
| "Environmental protection and fire-resistance PC shell with flame retardant at 1382℉" | Contradicted | L5 fire_safety_risk (4%) shows units catching fire and burning wall outlets, directly contradicting fire-resistance claims |
| "RoHS, ETL Certificates" | Unverifiable | No user reviews verify certifications; fire safety incidents raise questions about ETL certification validity |
