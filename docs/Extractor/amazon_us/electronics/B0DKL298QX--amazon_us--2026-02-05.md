- AppleCare+ service experience (no mentions)
- Wi-Fi 6E performance (no mentions)

⚠️ **Quality Control Investigation**:

### Confidence Levels

| Layer | Confidence | Reasoning |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| L1 (Identity) | High | Clear product identification from Amazon listing |

| L5 (Pain Points) | Low-Medium | Quality control issues significant but may be outliers; need more data |

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate**: Monitor quality control patterns across more reviews (target: 100+ reviews)
2. **Validation Needed**: Cross-reference with Apple Store reviews, tech review sites for battery/display performance
3. **Watch For**: Additional reports of receiving used/defective items (potential seller/fulfillment issue)
