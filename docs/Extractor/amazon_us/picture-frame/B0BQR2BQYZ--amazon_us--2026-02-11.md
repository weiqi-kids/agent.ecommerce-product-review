### 聲明驗證

| 聲明 | 驗證結果 | 證據 |
|------|---------|------|
| Sturdy frame | ❌ 與部分評論矛盾 | Multiple reviews report frames breaking/falling apart: "Put picture in frame and was ready to hang it the frame came apart", "Received broken in half", "Really cheap The front broke immediately" |
| Safe packing / Protective packaging | ❌ 與多數評論矛盾 | High rate of damaged arrivals: "this frame arrived completely cracked", "The first one came with its plexiglass shattered. The replacement came with its plexiglass shattered", "Product NOT as described...Item arrived in brown paper envelope with NO padding and a corner torn" |
| High definition cover | ⚠️ 材質爭議 | Product uses plastic/acrylic not glass. Some users appreciate clarity: "The glass piece is acrylic, but is extremely clear with hardly any light reflection", but others complain: "No glass, its a flimsy cheap piece of plastic", "The incredibly cheap plastic front scratches when you breathe on it" |
| Display size 0.5 inch smaller | ⚠️ 部分爭議 | One review contradicts: "The matted section is 2'x3\" not 2.5\"x3.5\". Why does is say it's matted to a size it isn't. Crops out 20% of the image" |
| Easy mounting with spring type action | ✅ 大致符合 | Users confirm easy use: "Super easy to use", "I love the fact the prongs spring up and down when taking the back on and off" |

**Confidence**: 中

**Notes**:
- 此產品在包裝保護和品質耐用性方面與官方聲明存在嚴重矛盾

- 價格顯示異常（$251.68 遠高於評論中提及的 $6-$20 範圍），可能為數據錯誤
