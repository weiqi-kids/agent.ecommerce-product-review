## L6: Evidence-Based Summary

### Strengths

1. **cradle_cap_effectiveness** (95% positive, 18 mentions): Highly effective at treating cradle cap and dry scalp conditions. Multiple users report visible improvements after single use, with gentle lifting of flakes without scratching or irritation. Works well for both mild and severe cases.

2. **gentleness_on_skin** (92% positive, 15 mentions): Extremely soft 100% silicone material is safe for newborn and sensitive skin. No reports of irritation or scratching when used properly. Parents appreciate the gentle massage-like action rather than harsh scrubbing.

3. **cleaning_ease** (94% positive, 10 mentions): Easy to rinse clean, dries quickly, and does not harbor mold or odors. Significant improvement over traditional washcloths that retain moisture. Low maintenance hygiene is a key advantage.

4. **dry_skin_treatment** (93% positive, 12 mentions): Effectively removes dry skin buildup and flakes during bath time. Users report improved scalp health without needing additional specialized products.

5. **quality_durability** (90% positive, 7 mentions): Long-lasting silicone construction holds up well over extended use (1+ years reported). Good quality control in manufacturing.

### Weaknesses

1. **slippery_grip_control** (4% report): Some users find the grip awkward or slippery when wet, requiring firm hold to maintain control during gentle washing. Not a dealbreaker but affects ease of use.

2. **received_dirty_defective** (4% report): Isolated cases of receiving product in unsanitary condition (dirty, with bugs). Packaging or warehouse handling issue rather than product design flaw.

3. **ineffective_no_results** (4% report): Small minority see no noticeable improvement with cradle cap treatment. May be due to severity of condition or user technique.

4. **causes_pain** (2% report): One report of product hurting baby. Likely due to excessive pressure during use rather than product design issue.
