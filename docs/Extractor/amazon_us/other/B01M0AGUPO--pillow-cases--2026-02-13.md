### Claim vs. Reality

| Claim | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| "Premium, hotel quality fabric that's made to last, with strong, durable construction" | Partial | While softness is confirmed (8/20 mentions, 95% positive), durability claims are unverified by this sample. One user noted thin material, suggesting "premium" quality may be overstated. |
| "Double-brushed microfiber yarns for an ultra soft touch" | Supported | Strongly supported by 8 reviews specifically mentioning softness, with consistently positive feedback (95% score). |
| "Machine washable" | Supported | 2 reviews confirmed "wash well" with no negative reports about washing performance. |
| "Great universal fit for both 20x36 & 20x40 pillows" | Partial | 3 reviews said "Fit perfect" or mentioned good fit, but 1 review noted the envelope flap could be deeper to secure the pillow better. Fits queen size confirmed. |
| "Breathable, lighter than air comfort that's never too hot or too cold" | Unverifiable | No reviews in this sample specifically mentioned temperature regulation or breathability. |
| "Ultra soft, shrinkage, stain and fade resistant, wrinkle free" | Partial | Softness strongly supported (8 mentions). Resistance claims (shrinkage, stain, fade, wrinkle) are unverified in this sample - no reviews provided long-term feedback on these aspects. |
