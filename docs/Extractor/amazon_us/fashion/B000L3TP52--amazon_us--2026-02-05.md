### Recommendations

**For Potential Buyers**:
1. ⚠️ **Proceed with caution** - While 80% have positive experiences, the 20% negative rate includes critical failures (unwearable after wash)
2. 📏 **Order one size up** - To account for potential shrinkage issues
3. 🧪 **Test wash carefully** - Wash in cold water, air dry first time to minimize shrinkage risk
4. 🔍 **Inspect upon arrival** - Check material feel and composition tag immediately; return if rough or incorrect blend
5. 💰 **Consider price vs. risk** - At "premium" pricing, the quality inconsistency may not justify the cost

**For Seller/Manufacturer**:
1. 🏭 **Standardize manufacturing** - Address batch-to-batch quality variations
2. 📝 **Update product listings** - Ensure material composition is accurately described
3. 🔬 **Improve quality control** - Implement stricter QC for material consistency and durability
4. 🧵 **Address shrinkage** - Review pre-shrinking process or adjust sizing specifications
5. 🎨 **Improve print quality** - Address lettering durability issues with better adhesion/printing methods
