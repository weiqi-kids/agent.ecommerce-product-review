**Risk Factors**:
- First-time use without patch test
- Sensitive or compromised skin barrier

**Mitigation**: Patch test required, start with short contact time (30 seconds), use every other day initially

#### 2. Chemical Burns / Over-drying (10 cases, 10%)
**Pattern**: Extreme dryness, skin cracking, lip damage
**Evidence**:
- "corner of my mouth have a constant crack/blister. I stopped using it and the blister went away. I started back using it last week and the blister came right back"

- "It dried up my lips something fierce"

**Risk Factors**:

### Known Limitations

1. **Time Window**: Reviews only from Jan-Feb 2026 (28 days), may not capture seasonal variations
2. **Selection Bias**: Amazon's review selection algorithm may prioritize certain reviews
3. **Language Barrier**: Spanish reviews analyzed via English translation, nuance may be lost
4. **Lab Claims**: Cannot independently verify "99% bacteria kill" or "data on file" claims
5. **Missing Data**: No UPC provided, category breadcrumb empty
6. **Long-term Effects**: Limited reviews discussing use beyond 1 year

### Recommendations for Higher Confidence

1. Analyze reviews from extended time period (6-12 months)
2. Cross-reference with competitor products (CeraVe SA, Neutrogena BP)
3. Verify dermatologist recommendations through medical sources
4. Compare with FDA adverse event reports (if available)
5. Seek independent lab testing of bacterial kill rate claim

### Final Assessment

**Overall Data Confidence: High (85%)**

This extraction is based on 100 verified purchase reviews from a highly-rated, established product with consistent user experiences. The main limitation is the inability to independently verify proprietary lab claims and the concentrated time window of reviews.

**Key Reliability Factors**:
- ✅ 98% verified purchases
- ✅ Official Amazon seller
- ✅ Consistent product metadata across batches
- ✅ Detailed, varied user experiences
- ✅ Presence of critical reviews (8%)
- ⚠️ Limited to recent reviews (28-day window)
- ⚠️ Cannot verify lab study claims

**Recommended Use of This Data**:
This extraction provides reliable insights into user experiences, effectiveness patterns, and safety concerns. Product claims should be noted as "manufacturer-stated" rather than independently verified. Issue frequency rates are accurate for this review sample but may vary in larger population.
