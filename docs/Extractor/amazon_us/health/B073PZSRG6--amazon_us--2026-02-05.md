## L6: Evidence-Based Summary

### Strengths
1. **taste** (78% positive, 23 mentions): Most children enjoy the cherry, white grape, and mixed berry flavors, with many parents reporting that kids willingly take them daily and some even request more. The taste is compared favorably to candy.
2. **nutritional_value** (95% positive, 15 mentions): Parents appreciate the comprehensive formula with 16 nutrients including Omega-3 EPA/DHA, methylated folate, vitamin D3, and other bioavailable nutrient forms. Multiple reviews mention pediatrician approval and Clean Label Project certification.
3. **child_acceptance** (82% positive, 18 mentions): High acceptance rate among children, with many kids asking for their vitamins daily without parental reminders. Some parents report children viewing them as treats rather than medicine.
4. **ingredient_quality** (98% positive, 7 mentions): Users consistently praise the clean ingredient list, absence of synthetic colors and artificial flavors, and the use of premium nutrient forms like methylcobalamin and D3.

### Weaknesses
1. **melting_sticking** (18% report): Significant recurring issue with gummies melting together and sticking to the bottom of the bottle, making them difficult or impossible to use. Multiple customers report this happening with consecutive purchases, suggesting a manufacturing or storage issue rather than isolated shipping incidents.
2. **taste_too_sour** (6% report): Small subset of children find the flavor too sour or tangy, even those who typically enjoy sour candies. This appears related to individual taste preferences.
3. **sugar_coating_issues** (6% report): Some parents and children dislike the sugar crystal coating on the gummies, with concerns about hyperactivity and texture preference.
4. **suspicious_packaging** (4% report): Rare but serious reports of bottles arriving with sticky residue, chemical smell, or opened seals, raising safety concerns.
