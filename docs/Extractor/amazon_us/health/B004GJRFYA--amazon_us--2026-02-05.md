2. **ease_of_swallowing** (95% positive, 12 mentions): The small softgel capsules are highly praised for being easy to swallow. Several users specifically note that these are ideal for people who have difficulty swallowing larger pills.
3. **brand_trust** (94% positive, 15 mentions): Nature Made enjoys strong brand loyalty with many users reporting years of continued use. The brand's reputation as the #1 pharmacist-recommended vitamin brand contributes to consumer confidence.
4. **price_value** (88% positive, 8 mentions): Reviewers consistently highlight the competitive pricing and good value, especially when compared to brick-and-mortar drug stores. The 100-day supply offers long-term value.

### Claim vs. Reality

| Claim | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| "Supports bone, teeth, muscle and immune health" | Supported | Multiple users report improved blood test results and general well-being. One user specifically noted lower PSA levels, suggesting broader health benefits. |
| "Contains 25mcg (1000 IU) of Vitamin D3, the body's preferred form of Vitamin D" | Supported | Users confirm accurate dosage, with several noting preference for the 1000 IU dosage level over higher amounts. |
| "Enhances calcium absorption" | Unverifiable | Users acknowledge the mechanism ("d3 helps body 'absorb' calcium from digested food") but no direct evidence of calcium absorption improvement in reviews. |
| "No color added and no artificial flavors" | Supported | Multiple reviewers confirm "no strong smell" and appreciate the clean ingredient profile. |
| "#1 Pharmacist Recommended Vitamin & Supplement Brand" | Supported | Users reference trusting the brand based on its reputation, with several noting doctor/pharmacist recommendations. |

| "Contains no artificial flavors, colors, preservatives, yeast, starch, or gluten" | Supported | Users appreciate the clean formulation, with one specifically noting "no strong smell." |
