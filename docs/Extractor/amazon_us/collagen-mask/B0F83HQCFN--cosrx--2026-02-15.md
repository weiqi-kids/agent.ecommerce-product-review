## L2: Claim Extraction

### Marketing Claims vs User Experience

| Claim | Evidence from Reviews | Verification Status |

| "Deeply moisturizes the skin" | Strong positive - "deeply hydrated", "my skin felt firmer", "beautifully hydrated skin", "very hydrating and it makes my skin glow" | ✅ VERIFIED |
| "Enhances firmness and helps improve elasticity" | Moderate positive - "enhance firmness", "tightens up my jowls", "plumper, calmer", "noticeably more hydrated and soothed" | ✅ VERIFIED |
| "100% experienced elastic skin" (clinical trial) | Cannot verify clinical trial, but user reviews show mixed results - many positive but some report no effect or short duration | ⚠️ PARTIALLY VERIFIED |
| "Mask turns transparent as it delivers ingredients" | Confirmed by users - "after 2-3 hours or when the mask turns transparent", "I noticed the effects lasting well into the evening" | ✅ VERIFIED |
| "Wear overnight" | Mixed feedback - "I did it overnight and let me tell u amazing", but others say "sleeping in it is not ideal", "couldn't imagine wearing it overnight" | ⚠️ PARTIALLY VERIFIED |
| "Achieve radiant and plump skin with just 1 mask" | Strong positive - "glowing from within", "skin looked noticeably plumper", "my face was moisturized", "glass glow" effect reported | ✅ VERIFIED |

### Discrepancies

2. **Duration of effects**: Some users report effects last only 12 hours, not as long-lasting as implied
3. **Cooling sensation**: Not mentioned in marketing but consistently reported by users (some found it too cold initially)

### Confidence Level

- **Medium confidence** in overnight wear capability (depends on sleep position)
- **Medium confidence** in firmness claims (subjective, varies by user)
