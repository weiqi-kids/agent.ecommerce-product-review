|---|---|---|
| "Ready-to-play Commander deck" | Supported | Multiple reviews confirm the deck is playable and fun out of the box, with one noting it's "very fun" and suitable for new players from Universes Beyond |
| "100-card Dance of the Elements deck with 12 new cards (including 2 foil Mythics)" | Partial | While card quality is confirmed as good, no reviews explicitly verify the card count or foil contents |
| "Includes deck box, 10 double-sided token cards, strategy insert, reference card" | Contradicted | One customer reported the deck box was missing from their package, though other components were present |
| "Explore this dual-aspect plane filled with enchanting creatures" | Unverifiable | No reviews discuss the thematic or lore aspects of the Lorwyn dual-aspect plane |
| "Embrace the powers of order and chaos" | Partial | One review mentions "Evoking the biggest elementals, and just playing them quick with many buffs" suggesting elemental mechanics work well, but no specific mention of order/chaos themes |
