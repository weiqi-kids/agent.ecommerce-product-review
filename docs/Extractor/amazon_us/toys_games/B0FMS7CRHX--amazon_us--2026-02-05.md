### 4. Size/Dimensions
**Weighted Score**: 4.2/5.0
**Evidence**:
- "The size is great, doesn't take up more room than we would like." (5⭐)

**Analysis**: Size perception is mixed. Most customers are satisfied with the compact size, appreciating that it doesn't take up excessive space. However, some collectors who mix this set with other LEGO Botanicals note that these flowers are noticeably smaller, requiring them to be used as accents rather than centerpieces. The product listing clearly states dimensions (larger daisy over 7.5 in. tall), so this appears to be a matter of expectation management rather than product misrepresentation.

The set strikes a good balance of being simple enough for young builders while still being engaging for older children and adults.

### 8. Build Time
**Weighted Score**: 5.0/5.0
