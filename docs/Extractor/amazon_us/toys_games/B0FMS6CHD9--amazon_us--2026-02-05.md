## Review Notes

**Reasons for REVIEW_NEEDED flag:**
1. **Incomplete product metadata**: Product title shows as "Unknown Product", brand is missing, price is $0.00, and average rating is 0.00 with 0 total ratings. This suggests the scraper failed to extract basic product information from the product page.
2. **Missing product description**: No description or bullet_points were captured, making L2 claim extraction impossible.
3. **Limited review sample**: Only 10 reviews were collected (minimum threshold). While this meets the bare minimum for analysis, it represents a small sample size that may not be representative of the overall product reception.
4. **Product identification issue**: The product was identified as a LEGO car set based solely on review content rather than official product metadata, which could lead to misclassification.

**Confidence rating justification:**
- Confidence is rated as "low" due to incomplete metadata and small sample size
- All 10 reviews are verified purchases and in English, which is positive
- Reviews span from 2026-01-14 to 2026-01-31 (17 days), showing a healthy temporal distribution
- No suspicious review patterns detected (verified_purchase ratio: 100%)
- Sentiment analysis is reliable within the available sample, but extrapolation to the broader product reception is uncertain
