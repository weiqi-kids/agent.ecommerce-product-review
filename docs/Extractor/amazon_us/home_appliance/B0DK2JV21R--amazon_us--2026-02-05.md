## L6: Evidence-Based Summary

### Strengths

1. **Appearance** (92% positive, 18 mentions): Customers consistently praise the beautiful, natural look that adds warmth and character to their homes. Many report receiving compliments and describe the shades as looking "like a million bucks."

2. **Quality** (88% positive, 14 mentions): Multiple customers note that the quality exceeds expectations for the price point, with one customer comparing them favorably to $500 shades from professional window treatment companies.

3. **Customer Service** (95% positive, 8 mentions): The company demonstrates exceptional responsiveness, with reviews highlighting same-day callbacks, replacement of defective products over a year after purchase, and helpful guidance on measurements.

4. **Ease of Use** (87% positive, 11 mentions): The cordless mechanism operates smoothly and reliably, with customers finding them easy to raise and lower daily.

5. **Value** (90% positive, 5 mentions): Customers report excellent quality-to-price ratio, with custom-sized shades costing significantly less than alternatives while maintaining comparable quality.

### Weaknesses

1. **Hardware Quality** (65% negative, 7 reports): Multiple customers report that included screws break during installation, even when pre-drilling holes. This requires purchasing replacement hardware and drilling additional holes.

2. **Sizing Accuracy Issues** (6% report, high severity): Some customers received shades that were too short despite careful measurement, with disputes about what was actually ordered and difficulty getting refunds due to non-returnable policy.

3. **Privacy Performance Varies** (4% report): Certain materials (particularly Sarasota Camel) provide zero privacy and are completely see-through from both sides, despite product descriptions mentioning privacy varies by collection.

4. **Durability Concerns** (8% report): Reports of string mechanisms breaking, materials causing splinters, and shades not staying down suggest potential long-term durability issues for some units.

5. **Installation Difficulty** (moderate): While most find installation straightforward, some note it requires two people, specific tools, and online tutorials to complete successfully.

### Claim vs. Reality

| Claim | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| "Smooth appearance which accentuates the beauty of the natural woven materials" | Supported | 92% positive sentiment on appearance with consistent praise for beautiful, natural look |
| "Years of smooth and trouble free operation" | Partial | 87% positive on ease of use, but 8% report string breaks, splinters, and operation difficulties |
| "Customize up to 1/8th inch" | Partial | 72% positive on customization accuracy, but 6% received incorrect lengths with high-severity impact |
| "Hatteras and eastfield collections offer privacy" | Partial | Privacy works for some (58% positive), but 4% report complete transparency (Sarasota material specifically mentioned as problem) |
| "Shades raise evenly and stack into neat flat folds" | Supported | 87% positive on ease of use confirms smooth operation |
| "Child safe cordless" | Supported | No reports of safety issues; cordless design confirmed functional |
| "Limited lifetime warranty / 5 years material, 3 years mechanism" | Contradicted | One customer successfully got replacement over a year later, but others report non-returnable policy and refund denials for defects |
| "Practical and reliable... for years" | Partial | Positive 4-year longevity report exists, but string breaks and splinters contradict reliability claim |
