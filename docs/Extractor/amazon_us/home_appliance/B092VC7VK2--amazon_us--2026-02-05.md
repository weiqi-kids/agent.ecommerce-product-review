## L6: Evidence-Based Summary

### Strengths

1. **rug_stability** (70% positive, 35 mentions): The product effectively keeps rugs in place and prevents slipping, even with heavy foot traffic, pets, and robot vacuums. Users consistently praise the strong grip that holds rugs firmly without bunching up.

2. **ease_of_installation** (92% positive, 12 mentions): Installation is straightforward with the dual-side adhesive system. Users find the triangular design easy to apply to rug corners and floors with minimal effort.

3. **floor_compatibility** (88% positive, 10 mentions): The grippers work well across multiple floor types including hardwood, tile, porcelain, and marble. Users report consistent performance regardless of floor material.

4. **adhesion_strength** (68% positive, 42 mentions): When working properly, the adhesive provides very strong hold that keeps rugs secure during vacuuming and daily use. The triangular design maximizes contact surface area.

### Weaknesses

1. **adhesive_failure_short_term** (16% report): A significant minority of users experience complete adhesive failure within 1-2 weeks, with the product becoming "completely useless" and unable to hold rugs in place. This suggests quality control issues or sensitivity to certain floor/rug combinations.

2. **damage_to_rug_backing** (16% report): The adhesive is so strong on certain rug backings (particularly rubber or fabric-backed rugs) that it removes the rug backing material when attempting to remove the grippers, making the claimed reusability impossible and potentially ruining the rugs.

3. **not_reusable_as_claimed** (12% report): Despite manufacturer claims of reusability, users find that washing or removing the grippers results in permanent attachment to rug backing or loss of adhesion, contradicting the product's marketed benefits.

4. **damage_to_floor_surface** (4% report): In rare but severe cases, the adhesive damages hardwood floors by being too strong, pulling up wood splinters when removed even after very short application periods.
