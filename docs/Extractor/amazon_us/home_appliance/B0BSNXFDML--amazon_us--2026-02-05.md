*Generated: 2026-02-05 | Source: amazon_us | Reviews: 50 | Confidence: medium*

**Confidence Rationale**: Medium confidence due to moderate sample size (50 reviews) from single platform. The 24% leakage rate is significant and may indicate a systemic packaging issue that warrants human review. The watery consistency reports (6%) also merit attention as they contradict the "concentrated" marketing claim.

**Review Needed Reasons**:
1. Significant packaging/delivery issues (24% of reviews) suggest potential quality control or logistics problems
2. Product consistency complaints (6%) contradict the "concentrated" claim in product description
3. Mixed language reviews (some Spanish) on US listing, though this appears to be legitimate bilingual customer base rather than anomaly
