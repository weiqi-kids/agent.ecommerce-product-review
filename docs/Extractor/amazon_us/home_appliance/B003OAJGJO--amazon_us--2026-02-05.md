## L6: Actionable Insights & Recommendations

### For Manufacturers (Crock-Pot)

- **Impact**: Safety hazard, product returns
- **Recommendation**: Redesign base with 4-point support or wider footprint

**Quality Control Focus Areas**
1. **Control knob durability**: Markings wear off after 2 washes

   - Priority: MEDIUM

2. **Component reliability**: Knob mechanism failure after 3 uses reported
   - Action: Enhanced QC testing for knob assembly
   - Priority: MEDIUM

3. **Build quality perception**: Users note "lighter weight" and "cheesy base" compared to older models
   - Action: Review material choices to balance cost and perceived quality
   - Priority: MEDIUM-LOW
