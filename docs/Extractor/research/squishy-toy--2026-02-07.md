## Research Summary

### Problem Causes

#### Childhood Stress and Anxiety Statistics

Childhood anxiety and stress have reached concerning levels in 2026:

- **11% of children ages 3-17** have current, diagnosed anxiety (9% of males and 12% of females), based on US data from 2022-2023
- **Anxiety disorders affect 31.9% of adolescents** between 13 and 18 years old
- **Nearly 1 in 12 children and 1 in 4 adolescents** experience anxiety disorders, making them the most common psychiatric conditions in this age group
- According to WHO 2026 data, about **one in seven (~14%) teenagers has a mental health disorder**
- **83% of teenagers** cite school and the pressure to get good grades as a "significant" or "top" source of their stress

**High-Risk Groups**:
- 52% of LGBTQ+ youth experienced poor mental health recently
- 43% of teen girls reporting persistent hopelessness (an all-time high)
- 1 in 5 (22%) LGBTQ+ youth attempted suicide in the past year

**Sources**: [ADAA Facts & Statistics](https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/facts-statistics), [CDC Children's Mental Health Data](https://www.cdc.gov/children-mental-health/data-research/index.html), [WHO Adolescent Mental Health](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/adolescent-mental-health)

#### ADHD and Fidgeting Research

**Scientific Findings**:
- Research found that **fidgeting improved cognitive performance** in children with ADHD, with similar benefits observed in adults
- A quantitative analysis revealed that **participants exhibited significantly more fidgeting during correct trials** compared to incorrect ones (p<0.001)
- **Fidgeting increased during later task trials**, suggesting it may aid arousal and improve sustained attention
- Participants with **lower reaction time variability** (better sustained attention) showed significantly increased fidgeting, supporting the compensatory mechanism hypothesis

**Mixed Evidence on Fidget Tools**:
- While intrinsic fidgeting (natural body movements) benefits people with ADHD, the effectiveness of commercial fidget devices remains unclear
- **Fidget spinners had an overall detrimental effect on academic performance**, regardless of ADHD symptomatology
- However, one study found **immediate and large increases in on-task behavior** when fidget spinner intervention was implemented

**Research Gaps**:
- The use of fidgets as a universal educational support lacks a strong scientific evidence base
- Notable gap in studies focusing on adults with ADHD
- Current literature examining fidgets' effect on student behavior has significant limitations

#### Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD)

**What Are Fidgets for SPD**:
- Fidgets are small handheld objects designed to help individuals relieve stress, anxiety, or promote focus and concentration
- They provide sensory experience through tactile feedback, helping to divert excess energy and improve attention

**How Fidgets Help Children with SPD**:
- **Focus and Concentration**: Fidgets enhance focus by channeling excess energy through tactile feedback and sensory experience
- **Sensory Input**: Offer safe, non-disruptive outlet for tactile, auditory, or visual stimulation
- **Motor Skills**: Help develop fine motor skills by working small hand and finger muscles, boosting hand-eye coordination, dexterity, and strength
- **Calming Effect**: Sensory fidgets can be calming and help with focus for individuals with SPD, Autism, and ADHD

**Important Note**: Squirming and fidgeting are common symptoms of hyposensitivity in children with SPD. Under-sensitive kids might be fidgety and unable to sit still.

**Individualized Approach**: Each child has unique sensory needs, so not all fidgets work the same for each child. Multiple fidgets may need to be tried to find the best match.

### Solution Method Comparison

#### Squishies vs. Stress Balls

**Material & Design Differences**:
- Both made of polyurethane, but differ in properties
- **PU foam stress balls**: Firmer, recover shape more quickly when squeezed
- **PU squishy balls**: Softer, take longer to regain original shape, slower rebound

**Purpose & Effectiveness**:
- **Stretchy balls**: Designed to encourage play and imagination
- **Stress balls**: Specifically made to reduce stress and anxiety
- Squishies are an "offspring" of stress balls, coming in numerous sizes and shapes (ice cream cones, cupcakes, animals, fruits)

**Scientific Evidence**:
- Studies suggest stress balls work to reduce stress because **squeezing improves the nervous system** and **decreases stress hormones**
- The **pressure activates nerves in hands** that pass signals to the limbic region of the brain (responsible for feelings and emotions)
- However, **effectiveness varies among individuals** and research on effectiveness is mixed

**Specific Use Cases**:
- **PU squishy balls**: For people who want slow rebound and softer feel; popular in retail toy markets, therapy markets; often used as sensory toys for children with autism or ADHD
- **Traditional stress balls**: More effective for targeted stress relief with quicker rebound

**Limitations**:
- May not address all aspects of stress or anxiety
- May not effectively address complex or multifaceted sources of stress
- Unlikely to provide sufficient relief for severe anxiety disorders

**Safety Concerns**:
- Some squishies have raised concerns about **chemical off-gassing** and **strong odors** that can cause headaches
- Less commonly an issue with traditional stress balls

#### Pop-It Fidgets

**Research Findings**:
- A study evaluated effects on listening comprehension ability of elementary students
- In dental anxiety study, groups using pop-its showed **significant reductions in both pulse rate and anxiety scores** compared to control groups
- Combination of pop-it with tell-show-do technique produced the most notable decrease in anxiety indicators

**Limited Evidence**:
- Researchers note that fidget toys are marketed as "universal classroom support," but **evidence basis remains controversial** and largely reliant on theory
- Few peer-reviewed experimental studies exist

**Practical Considerations**:
- Pop-its, along with fidget spinners and light-up discs, **can be misused and cause classroom chaos**
- Researchers and teachers agree to **avoid the most distracting fidgets** (those that make noise or encourage throwing)
- Though research is ongoing, therapists' practical experience suggests fidget toys can be helpful for emotional and cognitive support
