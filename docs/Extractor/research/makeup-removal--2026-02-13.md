## 1. Problem Definition

### 1.1 What is the core problem?
Makeup removal is essential for maintaining healthy skin. Failure to remove makeup, especially before sleep, can lead to:
- **Clogged pores and breakouts**: Makeup mixed with sebum, sweat, and environmental pollutants traps bacteria
- **Premature aging**: Makeup prevents healthy collagen production and traps dead skin cells
- **Eye infections**: Mascara and eyeliner can clog oil glands and cause styes
- **Skin barrier disruption**: Leftover makeup residue prevents skincare product absorption

### 1.2 Why does this problem occur?
- **Makeup formulation**: Modern makeup (especially waterproof formulas) uses long-lasting ingredients that resist water
- **Daily accumulation**: Throughout the day, makeup mixes with oil, sweat, pollution, and dead skin cells
- **Convenience trade-offs**: People seek quick removal methods but often compromise effectiveness
- **Product selection confusion**: Wide variety of removal methods (wipes, micellar water, oils, balms) creates choice paralysis

## 2. Solution Methods Comparison

### 2.1 Makeup Wipes
**Pros:**
- Extremely convenient for travel and on-the-go
- No water or sink required
- Quick application

**Cons:**
- **Ineffective cleansing**: Wipes smear makeup around rather than removing it completely
- **Skin damage**: Rubbing and tugging can cause irritation and premature aging
- **Harsh ingredients**: Many contain alcohol, fragrance, and preservatives
- **Environmental impact**: Non-biodegradable materials (polyester, polypropylene) take 100+ years to decompose
- **Cost to water systems**: $441 million/year in additional operating costs for U.S. utilities

**Expert consensus:** Dermatologists strongly discourage daily use of makeup wipes.

## 3. Key Ingredients & Technologies

### 3.1 Micellar Technology
**How it works:**
- Micelles are tiny microspheres with hydrophilic (water-loving) outer shell and lipophilic (oil-attracting) core
- Attracts and traps dirt, oil, and makeup without harsh surfactants
- Doesn't require rinsing (though recommended for sensitive skin)

- [Micellar Water: Benefits, Uses, and How It Works for Skin Care](https://www.webmd.com/beauty/micellar-water)

### 3.2 Oil Cleansing Method
**Principle:** "Like dissolves like" - oils bind to oil-based impurities (makeup, sebum, sunscreen)

**Key oils used:**
- **Olive oil**: Rich in antioxidants, deeply nourishing (DHC Deep Cleansing Oil)
- **Jojoba oil**: Mimics skin's natural sebum, non-comedogenic
- **Safflower seed oil**: Lightweight, rich in linoleic acid (Clinique)
- **Sunflower oil**: Gentle, suitable for sensitive skin
- **Squalane**: Highly moisturizing, derived from olive or sugarcane

Allow oil-based cleansers to rinse away with water, preventing greasy residue
