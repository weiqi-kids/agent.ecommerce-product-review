# Hydrating Serum Research Report

**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Category:** Hydrating Serum (保濕精華液)
**Primary Problem:** Skin dehydration, moisture barrier damage, lack of plumpness

---

## Executive Summary

Hydrating serums address dehydrated skin by delivering concentrated moisture-binding ingredients to the skin's surface and deeper layers. The market is dominated by hyaluronic acid formulations, with increasing interest in multi-molecular weight technologies and alternative hydrators like polyglutamic acid and glycerin. Key differentiators include molecular weight variety, supporting ingredients (ceramides, niacinamide, vitamin B5), texture preferences, and price points ranging from $9-$195.

## Problem Analysis

### Core Issue: Skin Dehydration vs. Dryness

**Dehydration** (lack of water) differs from **dryness** (lack of oil):
- Dehydrated skin lacks water content, appearing dull with fine lines
- Dry skin lacks natural oils, feeling rough and flaky
- Many people experience both conditions simultaneously

### Causes of Dehydration

1. **Environmental Factors:**
   - Low humidity environments (winter heating, air conditioning)
   - UV exposure degrading skin's natural lipids
   - Hot showers dissolving protective lipids

2. **Skincare Practices:**
   - Over-washing or harsh cleansers damaging skin barrier
   - Excessive exfoliation stripping protective barrier
   - Skipping moisturizer or occlusive products

3. **Barrier Dysfunction:**
   - Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) when barrier is compromised
   - Decreased ceramide content causing dry, barrier-disrupted skin
   - Microscopic gaps allowing moisture to escape

## Solution Methods Comparison

### Primary Hydrating Ingredients

#### 1. Hyaluronic Acid (HA)
**How it works:** Humectant that binds water molecules (holds up to 1000x its weight in water)

**Molecular Weight Matters:**
- **Low MW (20-300 kDa):** Penetrates stratum corneum to deeper layers
- **High MW (1000-1400 kDa):** Stays on surface, forms protective film
- **Multi-molecular formulas:** Hydrate multiple skin layers simultaneously

**Benefits:**
- Immediate plumping effect
- Safe for all skin types
- Works well with other ingredients

**Limitations:**
- Not occlusive (needs sealing with moisturizer)
- In low humidity, can pull moisture from deeper skin layers
- Effect is temporary without proper application

**Research:** Raman spectroscopy studies show low MW HA penetrates epidermis/dermis, while high MW remains impermeable at stratum corneum surface ([PubMed Study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25877232/))

#### 2. Glycerin
**How it works:** Humectant with low molecular weight (92 daltons), penetrates deeper via aquaporins

**Benefits:**
- Clinical data shows it's "the most effective humectant available"
- Remains within skin longer than water
- Deeper penetration than hyaluronic acid
- Less likely to cause issues in dry climates

**Limitations:**
- Can feel sticky if not formulated properly
- Needs occlusion to prevent evaporation

#### 3. Squalane
**How it works:** Emollient that mimics skin's natural sebum, locks in moisture

**Benefits:**
- Highly effective at preventing moisture loss
- Lightweight, non-greasy feel
- Can be sustainably sourced from plants
- Anti-inflammatory properties

**Limitations:**
- Doesn't add hydration (only retains it)
- Must be used with humectants for complete hydration
- Works as occlusive, not primary hydrator

**Best practice:** Use HA/glycerin first, then squalane to lock in moisture

#### 4. Vitamin B5 (Panthenol)
**How it works:** Dual-function as both humectant and emollient

**Benefits:**
- Attracts and holds moisture in skin layers
- Penetrates lower skin layers with deep hydration
- Reduces trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL)
- Promotes production of structural lipids
- Anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties

## Ingredient Technology Trends (2025-2026)

### 1. Multi-Molecular Hyaluronic Acid (MMHA)
**What it is:** Combination of high, medium, and low molecular weights in one formula

**Benefits:**
- Hydrates both superficially and deeply
- High MW prevents water loss at surface
- Medium MW penetrates upper epidermis
- Low MW reaches deeper for sustained hydration

**Market adoption:** Healthcare professionals increasingly adopting multi-molecular products for enhanced penetration and extended tissue retention. Market projected to reach USD 4.07 billion by 2030 (7.46% CAGR).

### 2. Polyglutamic Acid (PGA)
**Emerging trend:** Positioned as top skincare trend for 2025

**Benefits:**
- Binds 4,000-5,000x its weight in water (4x more than HA)
- Larger molecular size stays on surface, forming protective film
- Increases skin's Natural Moisturizing Factors (NMF) production
- Protects hyaluronic acid properties when used together

**Brands adopting:** The Inkey List, Drunk Elephant, Allies of Skin, Charlotte Tilbury

## Application Best Practices

### Proper Usage to Avoid Dryness

**Critical rules for dry/low-humidity climates:**
1. Never apply HA to completely dry skin
2. Apply to damp skin after cleansing
3. MUST seal with emollient or occlusive
4. Consider using humidifier to maintain optimal humidity

**Why this matters:** In low-humidity environments, HA can draw moisture from deeper skin layers rather than the air, potentially causing net dehydration.

### Layering Order

**Correct sequence (The Ordinary guide):**
1. Cleanse
2. Apply HA serum to damp skin
3. Wait 30-60 seconds for absorption
4. Apply moisturizer or face oil
5. (AM only) Apply SPF

**Compatibility:** HA works well with niacinamide, ceramides, vitamin E, aloe vera. Pairs excellently with retinol to offset dryness.

**Avoid:** Heavy oils, thick emollients that can clog pores

### For Dry/Mature Skin
**Recommended ingredients:** Multi-weight HA, ceramides, peptides, squalane
**Texture preference:** Slightly richer serums, can handle some oils
**Benefits:** Plumps fine lines, supports barrier function

### For Sensitive Skin
**Recommended ingredients:** HA, panthenol, ceramides, allantoin
**Must-haves:** Fragrance-free, hypoallergenic, minimal ingredient list
**Products:** Aveeno Calm + Restore, Cetaphil serums, The Ordinary HA

### For Acne-Prone Skin
**Safe ingredients:** HA (non-comedogenic), glycerin, niacinamide
**Avoid:** Heavy oils (coconut, avocado), comedogenic emollients
**Application tip:** Use lightweight formulas, don't over-apply

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Breakouts from Serum
**Causes:**
- Comedogenic ingredients (coconut oil, heavy silicones)
- Over-application causing pore clogging
- Purging from actives (temporary, 4-6 weeks)
- Applying to dirty skin

**Solutions:**
- Choose non-comedogenic, oil-free formulas
- Use 4-5 drops only
- Double-cleanse before application
- Layer correctly (serum before moisturizer)

### Issue 2: Sticky/Tacky Texture
**Why it happens:** Pure HA naturally has sticky consistency

**Product innovation:** The Ordinary reformulated their HA + B5 (2024) to reduce tackiness while maintaining 2% HA concentration. Took 18 months of development.
