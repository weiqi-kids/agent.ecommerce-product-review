## 4. 技術原理 (Technical Principles)

### 4.1 Key Selection Criteria

**Cushioning Needs**:
- Thickness range: 1/8" (thin, portable) to 1/4" (standard) to 1/2"+ (extra cushion)
- Thin mats: Better for balance poses, less portable bulk
- Thick mats: Better for joint protection, less stable for balance
- **Recommendation**: 1/4" standard for most users; 1/8" for travel; 1/2" for therapeutic needs

**Grip Type Preferences**:
- **Floor Grip**: Prevents mat from sliding during use (PVC excels)
- **Hand/Foot Grip**: Prevents hands/feet from slipping on mat surface
- **Dry vs Wet**: Some mats grip better when dry; others when slightly moist
- **Texture**: Raised textures, patterns, or smooth surfaces affect grip feel

**Drying Time**:
- PVC: Fast-drying (non-absorbent)
- Natural materials: Slower-drying (can absorb moisture)
- Important consideration for frequent use or hot yoga

**Weight and Portability**:
- Ultra-light (<2 lbs): Travel yoga mats
- Standard (3-5 lbs): Home use, occasional transport
- Heavy (5+ lbs): Premium, dense mats for home studio
- Carrying straps and bags affect portability

**Eco-Friendliness**:
- PVC: Not eco-friendly, not biodegradable
- TPE: More eco-friendly, some recyclable
- Natural materials: Most eco-friendly, biodegradable
- Trade-off: Eco-friendly often means less durable (though premium natural mats challenge this)

**Durability Expectations**:
- Budget ($15-30): 1-2 years moderate use
- Mid-range ($50-80): 3-5 years regular use
- Premium ($100-150): 10+ years daily use (Manduka PRO example)

- Especially well adapted to thrive for long periods on yoga mats

**Health Risks**:
- Bacteria can cause skin conditions like rashes, plantar warts, ringworm, impetigo, and athlete's foot
- Shared mats increase infection transmission risk

**Prevention Importance**:
- Regular cleaning and disinfection essential
