## Problem Overview

### Definition
Eye puffiness (periorbital edema) and dark circles (periorbital hyperpigmentation) are common cosmetic concerns affecting the under-eye area. The condition manifests as:
- Mild to severe swelling around the eyes
- Blue, purple, brown, or black discoloration under the eyes
- Appearance of fatigue, aging, or poor health
- Shadowing from tear trough depression

### Affected Population
- **Universal**: All ages, races, and sexes
- **More common in**: Elderly, darker skin tones, people with family history
- **Prevalence**: In Indian study, 47.5% of cases in age 16-25, 81% women

## Root Causes

### 1. **Aging** (Primary Structural Cause)
- Tissues around eyes weaken and sag over time
- Fat shifts forward into lower eyelids causing puffiness
- Loss of collagen and subcutaneous fat
- Thinning skin (as thin as 0.2mm in periorbital area)
- Blood vessels become more visible through thin skin

### 2. **Fluid Retention**
- **Sleep deprivation**: Disrupts blood flow constriction, causes fluid pooling
- **Salt intake**: High-sodium diet leads to water retention
- **Alcohol consumption**: Causes dehydration and fluid accumulation
- **Hormonal changes**: Worsens during menstruation
- **Sleep position**: Lying flat allows fluid to settle around eyes

### 3. **Genetics & Heredity**
- Periorbital hyperpigmentation has strong genetic component
- Familial cases documented across multiple generations
- Dermal melanocytosis (Nevus of Ota, Nevus of Hori)
- Pigmentary demarcation lines extending to eye area

### 4. **Lifestyle & Environmental Factors**
- **Sun exposure**: Triggers melanin production, worsens hyperpigmentation
- **Smoking**: Accelerates collagen loss, thins skin
- **Lack of sleep**: 7+ hours recommended by CDC
- **Stress**: Raises cortisol, increases melanin deposition
- **Chronic rubbing**: From allergies or irritation

### 5. **Medical Conditions**
- **Allergies**: Hay fever causes inflammation, itching, rubbing
- **Thyroid disease**: Hypothyroidism causes fluid retention, puffiness
- **Dermatitis**: Eczema and contact dermatitis dilate blood vessels
- **Kidney disease**: Fluid retention throughout body
- **Anemia**: Low iron or vitamin B-12 may play a role

### 6. **Vascular Issues**
- Superficial blood vessels covered by thin skin
- Prominent vasculature shows as blue/purple hue
- Blood pooling under eyes creates dark appearance
- Worse with manual stretching (diagnostic test)

- Cooling effect (vasoconstriction)
- Use chilled thick slices for 10 minutes

**Tea Bags** (caffeinated)
- Caffeine reduces puffiness
- Antioxidants (green tea polyphenols)
- Soak in warm water, chill, apply 5 minutes

**Lymphatic Drainage Massage**
- Promotes fluid movement away from eyes
- Gentle tapping or pumping motions
- Direction: Inner corner → temple → jaw → neck
- Use ring finger (lightest pressure)
- 5-10 minutes daily

**Dietary Changes**
- Reduce salt intake
- Increase water consumption
- Limit alcohol
- Quit smoking

### Professional Treatments

#### **Chemical Peels**
- Glycolic acid 20%
- Lactic acid 15% + TCA 3.75%
- Improves pigmentation over 2-4 weeks
