## Detailed Classification Results

### ❌ 無法解決問題 (Core Function Failure)

**Frequency**: 16/50 reviews (32%)

#### Issue 1: Incorrect Dimensions - Photos Don't Fit
**Frequency**: 8/50 (16%)
**Severity**: HIGH
**Root Cause**: Systematic listing/manufacturing errors

**Evidence**:
- "Dimensions are not correct. Matt is 9.5x7.5" (R20EKZBGNHVYA)
- "Too small, does not fit a 9 x 12 picture without cutting off. Inside measurements are 8.5 x11.5" (R1J3Q59MRXWV6K)
- "This was advertised as 22x18 it is 13x19. Totally screws matting and picture." (R2N8OZD94G9YK7)
- "The description says the mat is 20x28, it's actually 18.75 x 26.75." (RBMZV0QEUDUZV)

**Impact**: Users cannot display their intended photos/artwork. Core function completely fails.

**Analysis**: This represents a **fundamental product integrity issue**. Multiple size variants (8x10, 12x36, 18x22, 20x28) show dimension discrepancies, indicating systematic errors in either:
1. Product listing information
2. Manufacturing specifications
3. Quality control processes

#### Issue 2: Plastic Cover Falls Out/Doesn't Stay Together
**Frequency**: 3/50 (6%)
**Severity**: HIGH
**Trend**: Emerging (recent reviews)

**Evidence**:
- "The plastic just falls out, the black pieces fall off and the frame edges were barely together" (R1M7E592NN34H0)
- "Parts don't stay together properly" (pattern across multiple reviews)

**Impact**: Frame cannot maintain structural integrity to hold photo in place.

#### Issue 3: Extreme Scratch Damage Obscures View
**Frequency**: 5/50 (10%)
**Severity**: MEDIUM-HIGH

**Evidence**:
- "The product arrived with a defect. The front of the clear plastic is scratched." (R2JOJ7VQZ7LWAZ)
- "The incredibly cheap plastic front scratches when you breathe on it. Total garbage." (R3IZ13TUCWTWNB)

**Impact**: Severe scratching makes photos unviewable or significantly degraded.

**Classification Rationale**: While the frame technically holds the photo, extreme scratching defeats the display purpose.

### ⚠️ 產生新問題 (New Problems Created)

**Frequency**: 30/50 reviews (60%)

#### Issue 1: Material Expectation Mismatch
**Frequency**: 28/50 (56%)
**Severity**: HIGH
**Problem Type**: Misleading product information

**Evidence**:
- "Plastic cover, not glass. Poor quality." (R3GNSDFMQCHOWZ)
- "Terrible item. It is flimsy plastic that you cannot see through. Not glass. Nowhere in the description does it says this." (R3M8QZ1RIJ4Q66)
- "Dollar tree quality. No glass, plastic flimsy clear plexi stuff in the frame." (R1M7E592NN34H0)
- "Not glass, its a flimsy cheap piece of plastic." (R3H2R1QL78GCWK)

**New Problem Created**:
- Buyers receive fundamentally different product than expected
- Forces returns/exchanges (time cost, frustration)
- Plastic scratches easily (ongoing maintenance problem)
- Perceived as misleading marketing

**Analysis**: Marketing emphasizes "high definition cover" and "sturdy frame" without clearly stating "plastic/acrylic construction." This creates expectation gap leading to:
- Return rate increase
- Customer dissatisfaction
- Trust erosion

**Note**: Some users (minority) appreciate plastic for safety in drop-prone locations, but this is not the primary use case.

#### Issue 2: Extreme Scratch Sensitivity
**Frequency**: 12/50 (24%)
**Severity**: MEDIUM-HIGH

**Evidence**:
- "It's 'NOT' scratch resistant because it left some residue and scratches behind in the top upper corner when I removed the sticker." (R3UBKNH7VQ2DPN)
- "The incredibly cheap plastic front scratches when you breathe on it." (R3IZ13TUCWTWNB)
- "Scratched easily" (pattern across reviews)

**New Problem Created**:
- Protective sticker removal causes permanent damage
- Normal handling creates visible scratches
- Requires extreme care beyond normal use
- Aesthetic degradation over time

#### Issue 3: Cheap Appearance
**Frequency**: 8/50 (16%)
**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Evidence**:
- "Does its job (holds a photo), but is not pleasingly esthetic. Very, very cheaply made and even looks cheap in person." (R3H2R1QL78GCWK)
- "Looks cheap" (repeated pattern)

**New Problem Created**: Product detracts from rather than enhances the displayed photo/artwork.

---

### 📦 與產品無關 (Logistics/Non-Product Issues)

**Frequency**: 18/50 reviews (36%)

#### Issue: Damaged on Arrival
**Frequency**: 18/50 (36%)
**Severity**: HIGH
**Classification**: Primarily logistics/packaging failure

**Evidence**:
- "Arrived dented." (R1M7E592NN34H0)
- "The front plastic piece has a cut in it somehow." (R3NOHZGUU9D74J)
- "Arrived with broken frame and broken flimsy PLASTIC cover." (RSW813OSYH4GD)
- "Frame arrived broken but didn't open until return window was closed." (R3GFDHTFG5ZAJ3)

**Analysis**: While 36% damage rate is extremely high, this is classified as logistics issue because:
1. Primarily packaging/shipping failure
2. Not inherent product design flaw
3. Intact units function (albeit with material quality concerns)

**However**: The soft plastic material makes the product particularly vulnerable to shipping damage. This represents a **packaging design mismatch** with material properties.

**Mitigation Required**: Improved protective packaging specifically designed for soft plastic cover.
