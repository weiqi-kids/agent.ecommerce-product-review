### Key Insight: No Universal Solution

**The acne problem is heterogeneous**, requiring different solutions for different manifestations:

1. **Surface whiteheads** → Mighty Patch (hydrocolloid absorption)
2. **Deep cystic acne** → PanOxyl (antibacterial penetration)
3. **Pore-related acne** → Medicube (chemical exfoliation)
4. **Body acne** → PanOxyl (cost-effective large-area treatment)
5. **Hormonal acne** → PanOxyl or Medicube (systemic approach)
6. **Sensitive skin acne** → Mighty Patch ONLY (other options too harsh)

**Users expecting a single product to solve all acne types will be disappointed.** Success requires matching product mechanism to specific acne manifestation.
