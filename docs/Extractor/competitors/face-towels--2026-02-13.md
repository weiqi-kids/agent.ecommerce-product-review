## Market Insights & Trends

### 1. Price Stratification

Clear three-tier structure:
- **Premium ($0.30+):** Clinical evidence, certifications, brand trust

- **Budget ($0.13-0.20):** Functional, price-focused

### 2. Key Differentiators

**What Makes Winners Stand Out:**
1. **Clinical Studies:** Clean Skin Club's 6-week study strongest selling point
2. **Certifications:** USDA Biobased, Dermatologist-approved, Eczema Association
3. **Material Transparency:** Eucalyptus viscose vs generic "plant fiber"
4. **Brand Trust:** Established brands (MakeUp Eraser) vs new entrants
5. **Bulk Discounts:** Ditoi's tiered pricing strategy effective

### 3. Gaps in Market

**Opportunities:**
- **Mid-price with clinical data:** Only Clean Skin Club has strong studies
- **Retail presence:** Most brands online-only (except Buttah Skin)
- **Subscription models:** Underdeveloped except Clean Skin Club
- **Specialty variants:** Acne-specific, sensitive skin-specific formulations

### 4. Consumer Concerns

**From Reddit & Reviews:**
